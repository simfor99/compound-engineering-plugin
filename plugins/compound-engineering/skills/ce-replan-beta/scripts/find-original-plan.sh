#
# find-original-plan.sh — Locate the original plan doc that an existing PR
# was implementing, if one exists in the working repo's docs/plans/ tree.
#
# Usage:
#   find-original-plan.sh BRANCH_NAME [PR_BODY_FILE]
#
# Inputs:
#   BRANCH_NAME    — head ref of the PR (used to score filename matches)
#   PR_BODY_FILE   — optional path to a file containing the PR body. When
#                    provided, the script scans the body for explicit
#                    'docs/plans/...' references and prefers them.
#
# Output:
#   The repo-relative path of the most likely original plan, or empty when
#   no candidate clears a minimum confidence threshold.
#
# Exit code is always 0 when the script ran successfully — empty output is
# not an error. Callers must check for empty stdout, not exit code, to
# detect "no match found".
